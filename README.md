### Problems creating a site with Hugo 
#### blog1 
The blog1 folder contains the code for a test site.  
Some instructions in the layout/ files are not being applied.
#### blog1-PublicDelete
The blog1-PublicDelete folder is a copy of blog1, and then the public/ folder was deleted.  
When the site was rebuilt, the public/ folder no longer contains the HTML and XML files.
